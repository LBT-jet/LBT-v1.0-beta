## Introduction
The linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model is aimed to simulate the interaction between high energtic partons and QCD matter in high energy heavy-ion collision. It employs the Boltzmann transport equation with QCD matrix amptitude to describe the multiple scatterings. Particularly, it places great emphasis on jet-induced medium response by tracing the propagation of not only jet shower partons but also the recoil partons. It also includes the back reaction, called "negative particles", to conserve the total energy and momentum during each scattering. For the current stage, it only considers the interactions between an energetic jet parton ($E > 2$ GeV) and a thermal parton in local equilibrium in the medium, and any interactions between jet partons are neglected. \

The LBT model has been widely used to calculate hadron and jet suppresion, anisotropy and correlations with $\gamma/Z$ boson. It has been validated to probe the light/heavy flavor parton-medium interactions by comfronting the experimental data. \

The LBT project was initiated and conducted by Prof. Xin-Nian Wang, a senior scientist at LBNL, and implemented with $t-$ channel elastic scatterings and medium-induced gluon radiation by his students or collaborators Han-Li Lin and Yan Zhu written in Fortran. To include the complete elastic scattering channels and make the code more standard and modern, it was re-written by Tan Luo and Yayun He. Afterwards, it was updated by Tan Luo and Shanshan Cao in order to describe heavy flavor transport.
