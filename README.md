# LBT
A linear Boltzmann transport model for jet quenching \
Authors: Tan Luo, Shanshan Cao, Yayun He and Xin-Nian Wang

## Introduction
The linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model is aimed to simulate the interaction between high energtic partons and QCD matter in high energy heavy-ion collision.  \
        This project was initiated and conducted by Prof. Xin-Nian Wang, a senior scientist at LBNL, and implemented with $t-$ channel elastic scatterings and medium-induced gluon radiation by his students or collaborators Han-Li Lin and Yan Zhu written in Fortran. To include the complete elastic scattering channels and make the code more standard and modern, it was re-written by Tan Luo and Yayun He. Afterwards, it was updated by Tan Luo and Shanshan Cao in order to describe heavy flavor transport.
